# Biotech/Pharma industry survey data analysis & visualization
the data is from an [anonymous survey](https://www.reddit.com/r/biotech/comments/18vq4rw/rbiotech_salary_and_company_survey_2024/) posted on reddit in r/biotech. 

since the great majority of the people that took the survey are from the US the analysis refer to the US market only. 

the aim is to shed some light on the biotech industry for employees, see how the salary changes relative to various parameters and paint a picture of the current state of the market.

the different analysis will come out once I finish them, it might take some time as I can only work on this project in my spare time.
